Slacks Hacks
============

Proof-of-concept rails app that serves up js/css for injecting into the
[hackable slack client](https://github.com/bhuga/hackable-slack-client).

Current examples:

 * restyles bot messages quite a bit
 * scrolls instead of wraps wide attachment messages (Great for bots!)
 * Colors your own messages slightly
 * **H E L V E T I C A**

The meat is in https://github.com/bhuga/slacks-hacks/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/main.coffee and https://github.com/bhuga/slacks-hacks/blob/master/app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss.
